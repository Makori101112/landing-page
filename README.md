# landing-page
I'll be creating a landing page based on a provided design. While aiming to maintain the essence of the original design, there's flexibility for minor adjustments and improvements.

For this, I will be using nothing but html and CSS Flexbox.

Section 1, complete:

Important Note(s) - try finding out why there is a grey spec at the top of the button.
Update - figured out the what the issue was. All I needed to do was insert 'border: none' into the button's CSS.

Section 2, complete:

Important Note(s) - today's task reaffirmed the importance of being intentional with html syntax placement. This determines how the CSS does its magic.

Section 3 & 4, complete:

Important Note(s) - nothing new today. Today's session only reinforced a lot of what I have outlined already. 

Done with the landing page! Looks pretty good - all html and clean CSS Code.
